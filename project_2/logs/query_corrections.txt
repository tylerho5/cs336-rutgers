FROM DenialReasons DR
JOIN LoanApplication LA ON DR.ID = LA.ID

```

In the original query, the error was due to referencing `DR.denial_reason_name` which did not exist in the `DenialReasons` table. The correct column name, according to the schema provided, is `denial_reason_name`. The corrected query now correctly references the `denial_reason_name` column from the `DenialReasons` table.

        This is a column name error. Check:

        4. Lookup tables (without 's') contain the actual descriptive names

```
This query correctly joins the `DenialReasons` junction table (`DR`) with the `DenialReason` lookup table (`DR2`) using the `denial_reason_code` to retrieve the descriptive `denial_reason_name`. It then groups the results by `denial_reason_name` and orders them by the count of occurrences in descending order, limiting the result to the most common denial reason.

In this corrected query, I have used appropriate table aliases (`DR` for `DenialReasons` and `DR2` for `DenialReason`) and ensured that the join condition references the correct foreign key (`denial_reason_code`) from the junction table (`DenialReasons`) to the lookup table (`DenialReason`). This should resolve the error message indicating that the relation "denialreasons_loanapplication" does not exist.

In the provided schema, there is no mention of a "location_id" in the "ApplicantRace" table, which is why the error message indicated a missing FROM-clause entry for table "l". The corrected query now correctly references the "location_id" from the "LoanApplication" table and joins it with the "Race" table using the "race_code" from the "ApplicantRace" table. This should resolve the error and provide the desired demographic information for applicants with loans over 500K.

    ApplicantRace AS AR ON LA.ID = AR.ID
JOIN 
    Race AS E ON AR.race_code = E.race_code
WHERE 
    LA.loan_amount_000s > 500
GROUP BY 
    L.location_id, E.race_name;
```

In the original query, the error was due to a typo in the table name `L.location_id`. The correct table name is `LoanApplication.location_id`. The corrected query now correctly references `LoanApplication.location_id`.
