FROM DenialReasons DR
JOIN LoanApplication LA ON DR.ID = LA.ID

```

In the original query, the error was due to referencing `DR.denial_reason_name` which did not exist in the `DenialReasons` table. The correct column name, according to the schema provided, is `denial_reason_name`. The corrected query now correctly references the `denial_reason_name` column from the `DenialReasons` table.

        This is a column name error. Check:

        4. Lookup tables (without 's') contain the actual descriptive names

```
This query correctly joins the `DenialReasons` junction table (`DR`) with the `DenialReason` lookup table (`DR2`) using the `denial_reason_code` to retrieve the descriptive `denial_reason_name`. It then groups the results by `denial_reason_name` and orders them by the count of occurrences in descending order, limiting the result to the most common denial reason.

In this corrected query, I have used appropriate table aliases (`DR` for `DenialReasons` and `DR2` for `DenialReason`) and ensured that the join condition references the correct foreign key (`denial_reason_code`) from the junction table (`DenialReasons`) to the lookup table (`DenialReason`). This should resolve the error message indicating that the relation "denialreasons_loanapplication" does not exist.

In the provided schema, there is no mention of a "location_id" in the "ApplicantRace" table, which is why the error message indicated a missing FROM-clause entry for table "l". The corrected query now correctly references the "location_id" from the "LoanApplication" table and joins it with the "Race" table using the "race_code" from the "ApplicantRace" table. This should resolve the error and provide the desired demographic information for applicants with loans over 500K.

WHERE 
    LA.loan_amount_000s > 500
GROUP BY 
    L.location_id, E.race_name;
```

In the original query, the error was due to a typo in the table name `L.location_id`. The correct table name is `LoanApplication.location_id`. The corrected query now correctly references `LoanApplication.location_id`.

Question: What is the average loan amount in the database? 

--- Original Query ---
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount
FROM LoanApplication
GROUP BY LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
1. Identify the relevant table: LoanApplication
2. Select the column of interest: loan\_amount\_000s
3. Use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by the loan amount in thousands.
4. Apply an aggregation function: AVG() to calculate the average loan amount.
5. No WHERE filters are needed as we are calculating the overall average.
6. No ORDER BY clause is necessary for calculating the average.
7. The final query plan:
   - SELECT AVG(loan\_amount\_000s) FROM LoanApplication

Since the question asks for the average loan amount, we do not need to join with other tables or apply WHERE filters. The aggregation function AVG() will compute the average across all loan amounts in the LoanApplication table.

--- Failed Query (Attempt {correction_attempts}) ---
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount

        Relevant schema:
        Schema for tables involved in the query:
**LoanApplication – fact table**

* ID: primary key
* loan\_amount\_000s, applicant\_income\_000s: dollar values in thousands

        Instructions:
        1. Analyze the Error and Hint.
        2. Compare Failed SQL to the Original Plan and Schema.
        3. Fix ONLY the error, keeping the logic consistent with the Plan.
        4. Ensure correct table/column names (case-sensitive) and aliases.
        5. Output ONLY the corrected SQL query in ```sql markdown tags.

        Corrected SQL Query:
    

--- LLM Correction Response ---
```sql
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount
FROM LoanApplication;
```

The error message "Authentication failed. Check your username and password." suggests that the issue is not with the SQL query itself but rather with the user's credentials or permissions to access the database. Since the SQL query is correct according to the original plan and schema, the fix involves ensuring that the user has the necessary permissions and that the correct credentials are used when executing the query.

Please note that the GROUP BY clause is not needed when calculating the average of a single column across all rows. The corrected query removes the unnecessary GROUP BY clause, aligning with the original plan to calculate the average loan amount without grouping.

```sql
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount
FROM LoanApplication;
```

This query will now execute successfully, provided that the user has the appropriate permissions and is using the correct credentials.

```sql

FROM LoanApplication;
```

In this corrected query, I've ensured that the table name `LoanApplication` is correctly capitalized, as PostgreSQL is case-sensitive when dealing with unquoted identifiers. The rest of the query follows the original plan, selecting the `loan_amount_000s` column and applying the `AVG()` function to calculate the average loan amount without any additional filters, GROUP BY, or ORDER BY clauses, as they are not necessary for this calculation.

Note: The error message "Authentication failed. Check your username and password." suggests that the issue is not with the SQL syntax but rather with the user's credentials. This error should be addressed separately from the SQL query itself, typically by ensuring that the correct username and password are provided when connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
