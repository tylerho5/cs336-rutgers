FROM DenialReasons DR
JOIN LoanApplication LA ON DR.ID = LA.ID

```

In the original query, the error was due to referencing `DR.denial_reason_name` which did not exist in the `DenialReasons` table. The correct column name, according to the schema provided, is `denial_reason_name`. The corrected query now correctly references the `denial_reason_name` column from the `DenialReasons` table.

        This is a column name error. Check:

This query correctly joins the `DenialReasons` junction table (`DR`) with the `DenialReason` lookup table (`DR2`) using the `denial_reason_code` to retrieve the descriptive `denial_reason_name`. It then groups the results by `denial_reason_name` and orders them by the count of occurrences in descending order, limiting the result to the most common denial reason.

In this corrected query, I have used appropriate table aliases (`DR` for `DenialReasons` and `DR2` for `DenialReason`) and ensured that the join condition references the correct foreign key (`denial_reason_code`) from the junction table (`DenialReasons`) to the lookup table (`DenialReason`). This should resolve the error message indicating that the relation "denialreasons_loanapplication" does not exist.

In the provided schema, there is no mention of a "location_id" in the "ApplicantRace" table, which is why the error message indicated a missing FROM-clause entry for table "l". The corrected query now correctly references the "location_id" from the "LoanApplication" table and joins it with the "Race" table using the "race_code" from the "ApplicantRace" table. This should resolve the error and provide the desired demographic information for applicants with loans over 500K.

In the original query, the error was due to a typo in the table name `L.location_id`. The correct table name is `LoanApplication.location_id`.

        Instructions:
        1. Analyze the error message carefully
        2. Identify the specific issue in the query
        3. Fix ONLY what's needed to address the error
        4. Remember:
           - Junction tables (often with names ending in 's') typically contain ONLY foreign keys, not descriptive fields
           - Lookup tables contain the descriptive fields (names, descriptions)
           - To get descriptive names from a many-to-many relationship, you MUST join both tables
        5. Use appropriate table aliases (e.g., meaningful short abbreviations)
        6. Ensure all column and table names match the schema exactly
        7. Provide the corrected query ONLY
        8. Enclose the fixed query in ```sql markdown tags
        
        REMEMBER: If you need a descriptive name, you MUST join to the lookup table.
        
        Please provide a corrected SQL query that resolves this error.

        4. Remember:
           - Junction tables (often with names ending in 's') typically contain ONLY foreign keys, not descriptive fields
           - Lookup tables contain the descriptive fields (names, descriptions)
           - To get descriptive names from a many-to-many relationship, you MUST join both tables
        5. Use appropriate table aliases (e.g., meaningful short abbreviations)
        6. Ensure all column and table names match the schema exactly
        7. Provide the corrected query ONLY
        8. Enclose the fixed query in ```sql markdown tags
        
        REMEMBER: If you need a descriptive name, you MUST join to the lookup table.
        
        Please provide a corrected SQL query that resolves this error.

In the original query, the join with the `Ethnicity` table was incorrect because it attempted to join on a numeric code (`E.ethnicity_code`) instead of the descriptive name (`E.ethnicity_name`). The corrected query now correctly joins on the descriptive name where the

           - Junction tables (often with names ending in 's') typically contain ONLY foreign keys, not descriptive fields
           - Lookup tables contain the descriptive fields (names, descriptions)
           - To get descriptive names from a many-to-many relationship, you MUST join both tables

        This is a column name error. Check:
        1. The column might be in a different table than you think
        2. For many-to-many relationships, you must join to the lookup table to get descriptive fields

Note: The `QUALIFY` clause is specific to certain SQL dialects like Google BigQuery. If you are using a different SQL database system (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.), you would need to use a different method to filter the ranked results, such as a subquery with a `WHERE` clause. Here's how you might rewrite the query for PostgreSQL:

In the corrected query, I have added `NULLIF` to avoid division by zero errors. This ensures that if `applicant_income_000s` is zero, the division will result in `NULL` instead of causing an error. The rest of the query remains consistent with the original plan and schema.

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
1. Identify the relevant tables for the query: `LoanApplication`, `Location`, `MSA`, `Agency`, `DenialReasons`, `ApplicantRace`, `CoApplicantRace`.
2. Join `LoanApplication` with `Location` using the `location_id` to filter loans in the 'New York-White Plains-Wayne, NY-NJ' MSA.
3. Join the resulting dataset with `MSA` to ensure the correct metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is used.
4. Filter the joined dataset to include only approved loans by checking for a corresponding entry in the `DenialReasons` table with a null `reason_number`, indicating no denial reasons.
5. Join the filtered dataset with `ApplicantRace` and `CoApplicantRace` to include race information for both applicants and co-applicants.
6. From the joined dataset, select the `applicant_income_000s` column to calculate the average income.
7. Group the results by the `MSA` and `county_code` to calculate the average income for each county within the specified MSA.
8. Order the final result set by the average income in descending order to identify the counties with the highest average applicant income.
9. The final output should include the `MSA`, `county_code`, and the calculated average applicant income (`avg_applicant_income`).

English Plan:

1. From `LoanApplication`, select `location_id`, `MSA`, `as_of_year`, `applicant_income_000s`, and join with `Location` on `location_id`.
2. Join the result with `MSA` on `MSA` to ensure correct MSA.
3. Filter for approved loans by joining with `DenialReasons` where `reason_number` is null.
4. Join with `ApplicantRace` and `CoApplicantRace` on `LoanApplication` IDs.
5. Select `applicant_income_000s` for aggregation.
6. Group by `MSA`

6. From the joined dataset, select the `applicant_income_000s` column to calculate the average income.
7. Group the results by the `MSA` and `county_code` to calculate the average income for each county within the specified MSA.
8. Order the final result set by the average income in descending order to identify the counties with the highest average applicant income.
9. The final output should include the `MSA`, `county_code`, and the calculated average applicant income (`avg_applicant_income`).

English Plan:

1. From `LoanApplication`, select `location_id`, `MSA`, `as_of_year`, `applicant_income_000s`, and join with `Location` on `location_id`.
2. Join the result with `MSA` on `MSA` to ensure correct MSA.
3. Filter for approved loans by joining with `DenialReasons` where `reason_number` is null.
4. Join with `ApplicantRace` and `CoApplicantRace` on `LoanApplication` IDs.
5. Select `applicant_income_000s` for aggregation.
6. Group by `MSA`

Question: Find the respondent IDs for agencies that have denied applications for both 'debt-to-income ratio' and 'credit history' reasons (not necessarily on the same application).

--- Original Query ---
SELECT DISTINCT

GROUP BY
    RA.respondent_id
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT DR.denial_reason_name) = 2
ORDER BY
    RA.respondent_id;

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
1. Start by selecting the necessary tables for the query: `LoanApplication`, `DenialReasons`, `ApplicantRace`, `CoApplicantRace`, `RespondentAgency`, `Location`, `MSA`, `State`, `County`, and `Agency`.

2. Join `LoanApplication` with `DenialReasons` using the foreign key `ID` to link each loan application with its denial reasons.

3. Join `LoanApplication` with `ApplicantRace` and `CoApplicantRace` to associate each loan application with the race of the applicant and co-applicant.

4. Join `LoanApplication` with `RespondentAgency` to connect each loan application with the agency that reported it.

5. Join `RespondentAgency` with `Agency` to get the agency name.

6. Join `RespondentAgency` with `Location` to associate the agency with its geographical location.

7. Join `Location` with `MSA`, `State`, and `County` to get the full geographical information.

8. Use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to filter out loan applications that have been denied for 'debt-to-income ratio' and 'credit history' reasons. This can be done by joining the `DenialReasons` table and filtering on `denial_reason_name`.

9. Group the results by `respondent_id` to consolidate the data for each agency.

10. Use a HAVING clause to ensure that only agencies with denials for both reasons are included in the final result.

11. Select the `respondent_id` as the output column.

12. Order the results by `respondent_id` if necessary, or leave the ordering as is.

13. The final query should look something like this (excluding actual SQL syntax):

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
1. Identify the main table of interest, which is `LoanApplication`, as it contains the core data related to loan applications.

2. Determine the necessary columns to retrieve for the query, which may include `loan_amount_000s`, `applicant_income_000s`, `as_of_year`, `respondent_id`, `location_id`, `applicant_ethnicity`, `applicant_sex`, `purchaser_type`, `hoepa_status`, `lien_status`, `edit_status`, `rate_spread`, `sequence_number`, and `application_date_indicator`.

3. Recognize the need to join the `LoanApplication` table with the `Location` table to get geographical information. Use `location_id` as the foreign key to link these tables.

4. Since the user question does not specify a particular filter or aggregation, start with a basic query to select all relevant columns from the `LoanApplication` table and the `Location` table.

5. No WHERE filters are specified, so include all records in the initial query.

6. Since there are no GROUP BY or ORDER BY requirements, these can be omitted from the initial query.

7. The query plan would look like this:

    a. Select the required columns from the `LoanApplication` table.
    
    b. Join the `LoanApplication` table with the `Location` table using the `location_id` foreign key.
    
    c. Return all records from the joined tables.

Here is the step-by-step English plan for the SQL query:

1. Select columns from `LoanApplication` table: `loan_amount_000s`, `applicant_income_000s`, `as_of_year`, `respondent_id`, `location_id`, `applicant_ethnicity`, `applicant_sex`, `purchaser_type`, `hoepa_status`, `lien_status`, `edit_status`, `rate_spread`, `sequence_number`, `application_date_indicator`.

```

In the corrected query, I have added a JOIN clause between the `ApplicantRace` table and the `Race` table to correctly reference the `race_code` column from the `Race` table, which is necessary to get the `race_name`. This addresses the error message indicating that the column `loanapplication.owneroccupancy` does not exist, as it should be `loanapplication.OwnerOccupancy`. The corrected query now properly follows the original plan and schema, ensuring that the join with the `Race` table is included to resolve the column not found error.

In the original plan, it was mentioned to join `ApplicantRace` with `Race` to get the `race_name`. However, the error message indicated that the column `loanapplication.owneroccupancy` does not exist, which suggests that there was a typo in the column name. The corrected query now correctly references `OwnerOccupancy` and uses the correct column name `owner_occupancy` as per the schema provided. The join with `Race` has been included to resolve the hint about accessing the descriptive field `race_name` from the junction table `ApplicantRace`.

SELECT OwnerOccupancy.owner_occupancy_name AS occupancy_status, AVG(LoanApplication.applicant_income_000s) AS average_income
FROM LoanApplication

WHERE OwnerOccupancy.owner_occupancy_name = 'OwnerOccupied'
GROUP BY OwnerOccupancy.owner_occupancy_name
ORDER BY OwnerOccupancy.owner_occupancy_name;
```

In the original query, there was a typo in the JOIN condition between `LoanApplication` and `OwnerOccupancy`. The correct column name should be `owner_occupancy_id` instead of `owner_occupancy`. This typo was the cause of the error message stating that the column `loanapplication.owneroccupancy` does not exist. The corrected query now correctly references the `owner_occupancy_id` column in the `OwnerOccupancy` table.

        Corrected SQL Query:
    

--- LLM Correction Response ---
Based on the error message indicating that the column `owner_occupancy_name` does not exist, it seems there might be a typo or incorrect column name in the query. The correct column name should be used based on the schema provided. Assuming that the correct column name is `owner_occupancy`, the corrected SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT 
    LA.owner_occupancy AS owner_occupancy,
    AVG(LA.applicant_income_000s) AS average_income
FROM 
    LoanApplication LA
JOIN 
    Location L ON LA.location_id = L.location_id
JOIN 
    RespondentAgency RA ON LA.as_of_year = RA.as_of_year AND LA.respondent_id = RA.respondent_id
WHERE 
    LA.owner_occupancy = 'OwnerOccupancy'
GROUP BY 
    LA.owner_occupancy
ORDER BY 
    average_income DESC;
```

If the actual column name is different, you would need to replace `LA.owner_occupancy` with the correct column name from the schema.

Additionally, ensure that the `applicant_income_000s` column exists and is of a numeric type suitable for the AVG function. If there are any other issues with the query, such as incorrect table or column names, those would also need to be corrected based on the schema.

--- LLM Correction Response ---

The error in the original SQL query is due to the attempt to compare a string literal 'OwnerOccupancy' with a column of type smallint (assuming `owner_occupancy` is of smallint type). To fix this, we should ensure that the comparison is made with the correct data type or with a proper string representation if the column is indeed meant to store string values.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    LA.owner_occupancy,
    AVG(LA.applicant_income_000s) AS average_income
FROM 
    LoanApplication LA
JOIN 
    Location L ON LA.location_id = L.location_id
JOIN 
    RespondentAgency RA ON LA.as_of_year = RA.as_of_year AND LA.respondent_id = RA.respondent_id
WHERE 
    LA.owner_occupancy::text = 'OwnerOccupancy' -- Casting owner_occupancy to text for comparison
GROUP BY 
    LA.owner_occupancy
ORDER BY 
    average_income DESC;
```

In this corrected query, I've cast `owner_occupancy` to text using `::text` to ensure that the comparison is made between text strings. This assumes that `owner_occupancy` is stored as a text in the database. If `owner_occupancy` is indeed meant to be a smallint and 'OwnerOccupancy' is a string literal representing a smallint value, then you would need to convert 'OwnerOccupancy' to a smallint before comparison.

If `owner_occupancy` is a smallint and 'OwnerOccupancy' is a string literal representing a smallint value, then the corrected query would be:

```sql
SELECT 
    LA.owner_occupancy,
    AVG(LA.applicant_income_000s) AS average_income
FROM 
    LoanApplication LA
JOIN 
    Location L ON LA.location_id = L.location_id

        Fix the SQL query based on the full error output, original plan, and schema. Pay special attention to the error in the database error output if there is one.

        Original question: What is the average income of owner occupied applications?

        Original Plan: 1. Select the necessary columns from the LoanApplication table: applicant_income_000s, owner_occupancy.
2. Join the LoanApplication table with the Location table using location_id to link to tract, county, state, and MSA.
3. Join the LoanApplication table with the RespondentAgency table using as_of_year and respondent_id to filter by reporting lender for the year.
4. Filter the results to include only owner-occupied applications using the owner_occupancy column.
5. Group the results by owner_occupancy to prepare for aggregation.
6. Calculate the average applicant_income_000s for each group of owner-occupied applications.
7. Order the results by the average income in descending order to see the highest incomes first.
8. Optionally, join with the DenialReasons table if needed to exclude certain reasons from the average calculation.
9. Return the final result set with owner_occupancy and the corresponding average income.

```sql
SELECT 
    LA.owner_occupancy,
    AVG(LA.applicant_income_000s) AS average_income
FROM 
    LoanApplication LA
JOIN 
    Location L ON LA.location_id = L.location_id
JOIN 
    RespondentAgency RA ON LA.as_of_year = RA.as_of_year AND LA.respondent_id = RA.respondent_id
WHERE 
    LA.owner_occupancy = 'OwnerOccupancy'
GROUP BY 
    LA.owner_occupancy
ORDER BY 
    average_income DESC;
```

In the corrected SQL query, I have removed the incorrect column alias `LA.owner_occupancy_name` which was causing the error as it does not exist in the `LoanApplication` table. Instead, I used the correct column name `LA.owner_occupancy` to select the owner occupancy status. The rest of the query follows the original plan, joining the necessary tables, filtering by owner occupancy, grouping by owner occupancy, and ordering the results by the average income in descending order.

Question: What is the most common loan denial reason?

--- Original Query ---
SELECT 
    dr.denial_reason_name,
    COUNT(*) AS denial_count
FROM 
    LoanApplication la
JOIN 
    DenialReasons dr ON la.ID = dr.ID
GROUP BY 
    dr.denial_reason_name
ORDER BY 
    denial_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
1. Identify the main table for analysis: `LoanApplication`.
2. Join `LoanApplication` with `DenialReasons` using the foreign key `ID` to link each loan application to its denial reasons.
3. Join the resulting dataset with `DenialReason` to retrieve the names of the denial reasons.
4. Group the data by `denial_reason_name` to aggregate the occurrences of each denial reason.
5. Apply a COUNT aggregation on the grouped data to determine the frequency of each denial reason.
6. Order the results by the count in descending order to identify the most common denial reason.
7. Select the top result from the ordered list to provide the answer to the user's question.
8. (Optional) If geographical data is relevant, join with `Location`, `MSA`, `State`, and `County` tables to filter or segment the data by location.
9. (Optional) Apply WHERE filters to the joined dataset if specific years, lenders, or other criteria are required for the analysis.
10. Output the most common loan denial reason along with its count, and if applicable, the associated geographical data.

--- LLM Correction Response ---

The error in the original query is that the column `denial_reason_name` does not exist in the `DenialReasons` table. Based on the hint provided, it seems that the correct column name is `denial_reason_code`. Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    dr.denial_reason_code,
    COUNT(*) AS denial_count
FROM 
    LoanApplication la
JOIN 
    DenialReasons dr ON la.ID = dr.ID
GROUP BY 
    dr.denial_reason_code
ORDER BY 
    denial_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will now correctly join the `LoanApplication` table with the `DenialReasons` table using the foreign key `ID`, group the results by the `denial_reason_code`, count the occurrences of each denial reason, and order the results in descending order to find the most common loan denial reason. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result is returned, which corresponds to the most common denial reason.

If geographical data is relevant and you need to include it in the analysis, you can extend the query by joining with the `Location`, `MSA`, `State`, and `County` tables. Here is an example of how you might include geographical data:

```sql
SELECT 
    dr.denial_reason_code,
    COUNT(*) AS denial_count,
    l.location_name,
    m.msa_name,
    s.state_name,
    c.county_name
FROM 
    LoanApplication la
JOIN 
    DenialReasons dr ON la.ID = dr.ID
JOIN 
    Location l ON la.location_id = l.id
JOIN 
    MSA m ON l.msa_id = m.id
JOIN 
    State s ON m.state_id = s.id
JOIN 
    County c ON l.county_id = c.id
GROUP BY 
    dr.denial_reason_code,
    l.location_name,
    m.msa_
