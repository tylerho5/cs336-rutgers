FROM DenialReasons DR
JOIN LoanApplication LA ON DR.ID = LA.ID

```

In the original query, the error was due to referencing `DR.denial_reason_name` which did not exist in the `DenialReasons` table. The correct column name, according to the schema provided, is `denial_reason_name`. The corrected query now correctly references the `denial_reason_name` column from the `DenialReasons` table.

        This is a column name error. Check:

This query correctly joins the `DenialReasons` junction table (`DR`) with the `DenialReason` lookup table (`DR2`) using the `denial_reason_code` to retrieve the descriptive `denial_reason_name`. It then groups the results by `denial_reason_name` and orders them by the count of occurrences in descending order, limiting the result to the most common denial reason.

In this corrected query, I have used appropriate table aliases (`DR` for `DenialReasons` and `DR2` for `DenialReason`) and ensured that the join condition references the correct foreign key (`denial_reason_code`) from the junction table (`DenialReasons`) to the lookup table (`DenialReason`). This should resolve the error message indicating that the relation "denialreasons_loanapplication" does not exist.

In the provided schema, there is no mention of a "location_id" in the "ApplicantRace" table, which is why the error message indicated a missing FROM-clause entry for table "l". The corrected query now correctly references the "location_id" from the "LoanApplication" table and joins it with the "Race" table using the "race_code" from the "ApplicantRace" table. This should resolve the error and provide the desired demographic information for applicants with loans over 500K.

Question: What is the average loan amount in the database? 

--- Original Query ---
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount
FROM LoanApplication
GROUP BY LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
1. Identify the relevant table: LoanApplication
2. Select the column of interest: loan\_amount\_000s
3. Use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by the loan amount in thousands.
4. Apply an aggregation function: AVG() to calculate the average loan amount.
5. No WHERE filters are needed as we are calculating the overall average.
6. No ORDER BY clause is necessary for calculating the average.
7. The final query plan:
   - SELECT AVG(loan\_amount\_000s) FROM LoanApplication

Since the question asks for the average loan amount, we do not need to join with other tables or apply WHERE filters. The aggregation function AVG() will compute the average across all loan amounts in the LoanApplication table.

--- Failed Query (Attempt {correction_attempts}) ---

--- LLM Correction Response ---
```sql

```

The error message "Authentication failed. Check your username and password." suggests that the issue is not with the SQL query itself but rather with the user's credentials or permissions to access the database. Since the SQL query is correct according to the original plan and schema, the fix involves ensuring that the user has the necessary permissions and that the correct credentials are used when executing the query.

Please note that the GROUP BY clause is not needed when calculating the average of a single column across all rows. The corrected query removes the unnecessary GROUP BY clause, aligning with the original plan to calculate the average loan amount without grouping.

```sql
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount
FROM LoanApplication;
```

This query will now execute successfully, provided that the user has the appropriate permissions and is using the correct credentials.

```sql

In this corrected query, I've ensured that the table name `LoanApplication` is correctly capitalized, as PostgreSQL is case-sensitive when dealing with unquoted identifiers. The rest of the query follows the original plan, selecting the `loan_amount_000s` column and applying the `AVG()` function to calculate the average loan amount without any additional filters, GROUP BY, or ORDER BY clauses, as they are not necessary for this calculation.

Note: The error message "Authentication failed. Check your username and password." suggests that the issue is not with the SQL syntax but rather with the user's credentials. This error should be addressed separately from the SQL query itself, typically by ensuring that the correct username and password are provided when connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

            Error Type Hint: Column Not Found.
            Possible Causes:
            1. Typo in column name (check schema).
            2. Column exists in a different table than specified (check JOINs and aliases).
            3. Trying to access a descriptive field (e.g., `denial_reason_name`) from a junction table (e.g., `DenialReasons`) instead of the lookup table (e.g., `DenialReason`). You MUST join to the lookup table.
            4. Missing table alias or incorrect alias used.
            Check the original Query Plan/Breakdown for intended logic.
        
            Special Note for DenialReasons Queries:
            1. DenialReasons is a junction table that connects LoanApplication to DenialReason.
            2. To get denial reason names, you MUST:
               - Join LoanApplication with DenialReasons using ID
               - Join DenialReasons with DenialReason using denial_reason_code
            3. Example join pattern:
               LoanApplication ⋈ DenialReasons ⋈ DenialReason
            4. When counting denial reasons, make sure to:
               - Group by denial_reason_code and denial_reason_name

Question: What is the most common loan denial reason? 

--- Original Query ---
SELECT d.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM DenialReasons d WHERE d.denial_reason_name != 'None' GROUP BY d.denial_reason_name ORDER BY COUNT DESC LIMIT 1;

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*))(σ denial_reason_name ≠ 'None' (DenialReasons ⨝ LoanApplication))

TOP(1, 1)(γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*)))

This expression first groups the LoanApplication table with the DenialReasons table based on the denial_reason_name, then counts the occurrences of each denial reason name where it is not 'None'. Finally, it takes the top 1 result, which is the most common denial reason.

Note: This expression assumes that the 'None' value is used to indicate no denial reason. If there are multiple most common reasons, this expression will only return one of them. To get all the most common reasons, additional processing might be needed.

        Fix the SQL query based on the error, original plan, and schema. Pay special attention to the hint in the error message if there is one.

        Instructions:
        1. Fix the SQL query based on the error message and hints.
        2. Compare Failed SQL to the Original Plan and Schema.
        3. Ensure all necessary tables are properly joined, especially for junction tables.
        4. Use proper table aliases and qualify all column references.

            Error Type Hint: Column Not Found.
            Possible Causes:
            1. Typo in column name (check schema).
            2. Column exists in a different table than specified (check JOINs and aliases).
            3. Trying to access a descriptive field (e.g., `denial_reason_name`) from a junction table (e.g., `DenialReasons`) instead of the lookup table (e.g., `DenialReason`). You MUST join to the lookup table.
            4. Missing table alias or incorrect alias used.
            Check the original Query Plan/Breakdown for intended logic.
        
            Special Note for DenialReasons Queries:
            1. DenialReasons is a junction table that connects LoanApplication to DenialReason.
            2. To get denial reason names, you MUST:
               - Join LoanApplication with DenialReasons using ID
               - Join DenialReasons with DenialReason using denial_reason_code
            3. Example join pattern:
               LoanApplication ⋈ DenialReasons ⋈ DenialReason
            4. When counting denial reasons, make sure to:
               - Group by denial_reason_code and denial_reason_name
               - Count from DenialReasons (not DenialReason)

Question: What is the most common loan denial reason? 

--- Original Query ---
SELECT d.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM DenialReasons d WHERE d.denial_reason_name != 'None' GROUP BY d.denial_reason_name ORDER BY COUNT DESC LIMIT 1;

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*))(σ denial_reason_name ≠ 'None' (DenialReasons ⨝ LoanApplication))

TOP(1, 1)(γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*)))

This expression first groups the LoanApplication table with the DenialReasons table based on the denial_reason_name, then counts the occurrences of each denial reason name where it is not 'None'. Finally, it takes the top 1 result, which is the most common denial reason.

Note: This expression assumes that the 'None' value is used to indicate no denial reason. If there are multiple most common reasons, this expression will only return one of them. To get all the most common reasons, additional processing might be needed.

        Fix the SQL query based on the error, original plan, and schema. Pay special attention to the hint in the error message if there is one.

        Instructions:
        1. Fix the SQL query based on the error message and hints.
        2. Compare Failed SQL to the Original Plan and Schema.
        3. Ensure all necessary tables are properly joined, especially for junction tables.
        4. Use proper table aliases and qualify all column references.
        5. Maintain the original query's intent as shown in the plan.
        6. Output only the corrected SQL query, no explanations.

            Error Type Hint: Column Not Found.
            Possible Causes:
            1. Typo in column name (check schema).
            2. Column exists in a different table than specified (check JOINs and aliases).
            3. Trying to access a descriptive field (e.g., `denial_reason_name`) from a junction table (e.g., `DenialReasons`) instead of the lookup table (e.g., `DenialReason`). You MUST join to the lookup table.
            4. Missing table alias or incorrect alias used.
            Check the original Query Plan/Breakdown for intended logic.
        
            Special Note for DenialReasons Queries:
            1. DenialReasons is a junction table that connects LoanApplication to DenialReason.
            2. The table structure is:
               - DenialReasons: (ID, reason_number, denial_reason_code)
               - DenialReason: (denial_reason_code, denial_reason_name)
            3. To get denial reason names, you MUST:
               - Join DenialReasons with DenialReason using denial_reason_code
               - Access denial_reason_name from DenialReason table, NOT DenialReasons
            4. Example correct query structure:
               ```sql
               SELECT dr.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) as count
               FROM DenialReasons d
               JOIN DenialReason dr ON d.denial_reason_code = dr.denial_reason_code
               GROUP BY dr.denial_reason_name
               ORDER BY count DESC
               ```
            5. Common mistakes to avoid:
               - Trying to access denial_reason_name from DenialReasons table (it doesn't exist there)
               - Missing the join with DenialReason table
               - Using wrong join conditions

            Error Type Hint: Column Not Found.
            Possible Causes:
            1. Typo in column name (check schema).
            2. Column exists in a different table than specified (check JOINs and aliases).

            4. Missing table alias or incorrect alias used.
            Check the original Query Plan/Breakdown for intended logic.
        
            Special Note for DenialReasons Queries:
            1. DenialReasons is a junction table that connects LoanApplication to DenialReason.
            2. The table structure is:
               - DenialReasons: (ID, reason_number, denial_reason_code)
               - DenialReason: (denial_reason_code, denial_reason_name)
            3. To get denial reason names, you MUST:
               - Join DenialReasons with DenialReason using denial_reason_code
               - Access denial_reason_name from DenialReason table, NOT DenialReasons
            4. Example correct query structure:
               ```sql
               SELECT dr.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) as count
               FROM DenialReasons d
               JOIN DenialReason dr ON d.denial_reason_code = dr.denial_reason_code
               GROUP BY dr.denial_reason_name
               ORDER BY count DESC
               ```
            5. Common mistakes to avoid:
               - Trying to access denial_reason_name from DenialReasons table (it doesn't exist there)

        Fix the SQL query based on the error, original plan, and schema. Pay special attention to the hint in the error message if there is one.

        Instructions:
        1. Fix the SQL query based on the error message and hints.
        2. Compare Failed SQL to the Original Plan and Schema.
        3. Ensure all necessary tables are properly joined, especially for junction tables.
        4. Use proper table aliases and qualify all column references.
        5. Maintain the original query's intent as shown in the plan.
        6. Output only the corrected SQL query, no explanations.

            Error Type Hint: Column Not Found.
            Possible Causes:
            1. Typo in column name (check schema).
            2. Column exists in a different table than specified (check JOINs and aliases).
            3. Trying to access a descriptive field (e.g., `denial_reason_name`) from a junction table (e.g., `DenialReasons`) instead of the lookup table (e.g., `DenialReason`). You MUST join to the lookup table.
            4. Missing table alias or incorrect alias used.
            Check the original Query Plan/Breakdown for intended logic.
        
            Special Note for DenialReasons Queries:
            1. DenialReasons is a junction table that connects LoanApplication to DenialReason.
            2. The table structure is:
               - DenialReasons: (ID, reason_number, denial_reason_code)
               - DenialReason: (denial_reason_code, denial_reason_name)
            3. To get denial reason names, you MUST:
               - Join DenialReasons with DenialReason using denial_reason_code
               - Access denial_reason_name from DenialReason table, NOT DenialReasons
            4. Example correct query structure:
               ```sql
               SELECT dr.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) as count
               FROM DenialReasons d
               JOIN DenialReason dr ON d.denial_reason_code = dr.denial_reason_code
               GROUP BY dr.denial_reason_name
               ORDER BY count DESC
               ```
            5. Common mistakes to avoid:
               - Trying to access denial_reason_name from DenialReasons table (it doesn't exist there)
               - Missing the join with DenialReason table
               - Using wrong join conditions

Question: What is the most common loan denial reason? 

--- Original Query ---
SELECT d.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM DenialReasons d WHERE d.denial_reason_name != 'None' GROUP BY d.denial_reason_name ORDER BY COUNT DESC LIMIT 1;

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*))(σ denial_reason_name ≠ 'None' (DenialReasons ⨝ LoanApplication))

TOP(1, 1)(γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*)))

This expression first groups the LoanApplication table with the DenialReasons table based on the denial_reason_name, then counts the occurrences of each denial reason name where it is not 'None'. Finally, it takes the top 1 result, which is the most common denial reason.

Note: This expression assumes that the 'None' value is used to indicate no denial reason. If there are multiple most common reasons, this expression will only return one of them. To get all the most common reasons, additional processing might be needed.

            Error Type Hint: Column Not Found.
            Possible Causes:
            1. Typo in column name (check schema).
            2. Column exists in a different table than specified (check JOINs and aliases).
            3. Trying to access a descriptive field (e.g., `denial_reason_name`) from a junction table (e.g., `DenialReasons`) instead of the lookup table (e.g., `DenialReason`). You MUST join to the lookup table.
            4. Missing table alias or incorrect alias used.
            Check the original Query Plan/Breakdown for intended logic.
        
            Special Note for DenialReasons Queries:
            1. DenialReasons is a junction table that connects LoanApplication to DenialReason.
            2. The table structure is:
               - DenialReasons: (ID, reason_number, denial_reason_code)
               - DenialReason: (denial_reason_code, denial_reason_name)
            3. To get denial reason names, you MUST:
               - Join DenialReasons with DenialReason using denial_reason_code
               - Access denial_reason_name from DenialReason table, NOT DenialReasons
            4. Example correct query structure:
               ```sql
               SELECT dr.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) as count
               FROM DenialReasons d
               JOIN DenialReason dr ON d.denial_reason_code = dr.denial_reason_code
               GROUP BY dr.denial_reason_name
               ORDER BY count DESC
               ```
            5. Common mistakes to avoid:
               - Trying to access denial_reason_name from DenialReasons table (it doesn't exist there)
               - Missing the join with DenialReason table
               - Using wrong join conditions

Question: What is the most common loan denial reason? 

--- Original Query ---
SELECT d.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM DenialReasons d WHERE d.denial_reason_name != 'None' GROUP BY d.denial_reason_name ORDER BY COUNT DESC LIMIT 1;

--- Query Plan/Breakdown ---
γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*))(σ denial_reason_name ≠ 'None' (DenialReasons ⨝ LoanApplication))

TOP(1, 1)(γ(denial_reason_name, COUNT(*)))

This expression first groups the LoanApplication table with the DenialReasons table based on the denial_reason_name, then counts the occurrences of each denial reason name where it is not 'None'. Finally, it takes the top 1 result, which is the most common denial reason.

Note: This expression assumes that the 'None' value is used to indicate no denial reason. If there are multiple most common reasons, this expression will only return one of them. To get all the most common reasons, additional processing might be needed.

        Fix the SQL query based on the error, original plan, and schema. Pay special attention to the hint in the error message if there is one.

        Instructions:
        1. Fix the SQL query based on the error message and hints.
        2. Compare Failed SQL to the Original Plan and Schema.
        3. Ensure all necessary tables are properly joined, especially for junction tables.
        4. Use proper table aliases and qualify all column references.
        5. Maintain the original query's intent as shown in the plan.
        6. Output only the corrected SQL query, no explanations.

            Error Type Hint: Column Not Found.
            Possible Causes:
            1. Typo in column name (check schema).
            2. Column exists in a different table than specified (check JOINs and aliases).
            3. Trying to access a descriptive field (e.g., `denial_reason_name`) from a junction table (e.g., `DenialReasons`) instead of the lookup table (e.g., `DenialReason`). You MUST join to the lookup table.
            4. Missing table alias or incorrect alias used.
            Check the original Query Plan/Breakdown for intended logic.
        
            DenialReasons Query Pattern:
            1. DenialReasons (drs) is a junction table
            2. Must join with DenialReason (dr) on denial_reason_code
            3. Correct query structure:
               SELECT dr.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) 
               FROM DenialReasons drs 
               JOIN DenialReason dr ON drs.denial_reason_code = dr.denial_reason_code
               GROUP BY dr.denial_reason_name

This expression first groups the LoanApplication table with the DenialReasons table based on the denial_reason_name, then counts the occurrences of each denial reason name where it is not 'None'. Finally, it takes the top 1 result, which is the most common denial reason.

Note: This expression assumes that the 'None' value is used to indicate no denial reason. If there are multiple most common reasons, this expression will only return one of them. To get all the most common reasons, additional processing might be needed.
