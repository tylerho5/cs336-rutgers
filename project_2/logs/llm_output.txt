        Instructions:
        Create a step-by-step English plan for a PostgreSQL query based on the User Question and Schema.
        Focus on: Tables, JOINs (with keys), SELECT columns (table.col), WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregations, ORDER BY.
        Output only the plan, no SQL, no explanations. Be as concise as possible.

        Plan:
    

--- LLM Breakdown Response ---
1. Identify the relevant table: LoanApplication
2. Select the column of interest: loan\_amount\_000s
3. Use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by the loan amount in thousands.
4. Apply an aggregation function: AVG() to calculate the average loan amount.
5. No WHERE filters are needed as we are calculating the overall average.
6. No ORDER BY clause is necessary for calculating the average.
7. The final query plan:
   - SELECT AVG(loan\_amount\_000s) FROM LoanApplication

Since the question asks for the average loan amount, we do not need to join with other tables or apply WHERE filters. The aggregation function AVG() will compute the average across all loan amounts in the LoanApplication table.

        Instructions:
        1. Translate the Query Plan into a single, valid PostgreSQL query.
        2. Use fully qualified column names (alias.column) for ALL columns.
        3. Use meaningful table aliases.
        4. Follow the Plan's JOINs, filters, grouping, and ordering precisely.
        5. Match schema names EXACTLY (case-sensitive).
        6. If using aggregates, include non-aggregated SELECT columns in GROUP BY.
        7. Output ONLY the SQL query in ```sql markdown tags.

        SQL Query:
    

--- LLM SQL Response Start ---
```sql
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount
FROM LoanApplication
GROUP BY LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s
```

Note: The provided query plan does not include JOINs, filters, or an ORDER BY clause, as the original question does not require them for calculating the average loan amount. The GROUP BY clause is also not necessary when using the AVG() function with a single column, as it will calculate the average across all rows in the table. However, if there were additional requirements for filtering or ordering, those would need to be included in the query accordingly.

Since the question specifically asks for the average loan amount without any additional filters or grouping, the query above is sufficient. If there were a need to filter or group by specific criteria, the query would be modified to include those elements.

For example, if we wanted to calculate the average loan amount for a specific loan type, the query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT AVG(LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s) AS average_loan_amount
FROM LoanApplication
JOIN LoanType ON LoanApplication.loan_type = LoanType.loan_type
WHERE LoanType.loan_type_name = 'Home Purchase'
GROUP BY LoanApplication.loan_amount_000s
```

In this modified query, we join the LoanApplication table with the LoanType table, apply a WHERE filter to select only 'Home Purchase' loan types, and group the results by loan amount in thousands. However, this is not necessary for the original question as stated.

        Instructions:
        1. Translate the Relational Algebra Expression into a single, valid PostgreSQL query.
        2. Use fully qualified column names (alias.column) for ALL columns.
        3. Use meaningful table aliases.
        4. Follow the relational algebra operations precisely:
           - σ becomes WHERE conditions
           - π becomes SELECT columns
           - ⋈ becomes JOIN operations
           - ⋈θ becomes JOIN with ON conditions
           - γ becomes GROUP BY with appropriate aggregates
           - τ becomes ORDER BY
           - ρ becomes table aliases
        5. Match schema names EXACTLY (case-sensitive).
        6. If using aggregates, include non-aggregated SELECT columns in GROUP BY.
        7. Output ONLY the SQL query in ```sql markdown tags.

        SQL Query:
    

--- LLM SQL Response Start ---
```sql
SELECT 
    L.loan_amount_000s, 
    L.applicant_income_000s
FROM 
    LoanApplication L
JOIN 
    DenialReasons DR ON L.ID = DR.ID
JOIN 
    ApplicantRace AR ON L.ID = AR.ID
JOIN 
    CoApplicantRace CAR ON L.ID = CAR.ID
JOIN 
    Location LG ON L.location_id = LG.location_id
JOIN 
    RespondentAgency RA ON L.as_of_year = RA.as_of_year AND L.respondent_id = RA.respondent_id
WHERE 
    L.loan_amount_000s > L.applicant_income_000s
GROUP BY 
    L.loan_amount_000s, 
    L.applicant_income_000s
```
This query selects the loan amount and applicant income from the LoanApplication table, joins with the DenialReasons, ApplicantRace, CoApplicantRace, Location, and RespondentAgency tables based on the specified relationships, and filters the results to only include rows where the loan amount in thousands is greater than the applicant income in thousands. The GROUP BY clause is used to group the results by loan amount and applicant income.

        Instructions:
        Create a step-by-step relational algebra expression for the query based on the User Question and Schema.
        Use standard relational algebra notation:
        - σ for selection (WHERE conditions)
        - π for projection (SELECT columns)
        - ⋈ for natural join
        - ⋈θ for theta join (with conditions)
        - ∪ for union
        - ∩ for intersection
        - - for set difference
        - γ for grouping/aggregation
        - τ for sorting
        - ρ for renaming

        Example format:
        π column1, column2 (σ condition (Table1 ⋈ Table2))

        Output only the relational algebra expression, no SQL, no explanations. Be as concise as possible.

        Instructions:
        1. View the relational‑algebra expression as a roadmap to the tables, joins, filters, and columns you need. It is a guide, not a rulebook.
        2. Write one valid PostgreSQL query that answers the question. Add aggregates when the question requires them, even if they were not shown in the algebra.
        3. Use fully qualified column names (alias.column) everywhere and pick clear, short aliases.
        4. Match table and column names exactly (case‑sensitive).
        5. Output **only** the SQL, wrapped in ```sql markdown tags.
        
        SQL Query:
    

--- LLM SQL Response Start ---
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_mortgages
FROM (
    SELECT la.loan_amount_000s, la.applicant_income_000s
    FROM LoanApplication la
    JOIN DenialReasons dr ON la.ID = dr.ID
    JOIN ApplicantRace ar ON la.ID = ar.ID
    JOIN CoApplicantRace car ON la.ID = car.ID
    JOIN Location l ON la.location_id = l.location_id
    JOIN RespondentAgency ra ON la.respondent_id = ra.respondent_id
    WHERE la.loan_amount_000s > la.applicant_income_000s
) AS filtered_mortgages;
```

This query joins the necessary tables to filter out mortgages where the loan value in thousands is greater than the applicant income in thousands. It then counts the number of such mortgages. The subquery is used to ensure that the filtering condition is applied before the count is performed. The result is aliased as `num_mortgages` for clarity.
