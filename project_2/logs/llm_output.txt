This SQL query does the following:

1. It creates a subquery (aliased as `App`) that selects `location_id` from the `LoanApplication` table, grouped by `location_id`, and filters the groups using a `HAVING` clause to ensure that the sum of owner-occupied units (`owner_occupancy = 1`) is less than the sum of 1-to-4 family units (`property_type = 1`).

2. The main query selects distinct `state_name` and `county_name` from the `Location` table.

3. It joins the `Location` table with the subquery `App` on `location_id` to ensure that only locations with at least one loan application that meets the specified criteria are included.

4. The `WHERE` clause in the main query further filters the results to include only those locations where the number of owner-occupied units is less than the number of 1-to-4 family units.

Please note that the `property_type` is assumed to be represented by a small integer where `1` might represent 1-to-4 family units. Adjust the property type codes as necessary to match your actual schema.

Question: List the names of loan types for which the average rate spread (if available and numeric) is greater than 3.0.

--- LLM Response Start ---
```sql
SELECT LT.loan_type_name, AVG(CAST(LT.rate_spread AS NUMERIC)) AS avg_rate_spread
FROM LoanApplication LA
JOIN LoanType LT ON LA.loan_type = LT.loan_type
WHERE CAST(LT.rate_spread AS NUMERIC) IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY LT.loan_type_name
HAVING AVG(CAST(LT.rate_spread AS NUMERIC)) > 3.0;
```
This query joins the `LoanApplication` table with the `LoanType` table on the `loan_type` column. It then filters out any rows where the `rate_spread` is null to ensure that only valid rate spreads are considered. The `AVG` function is used to calculate the average rate spread for each loan type, and the `HAVING` clause is used to filter out loan types where the average rate spread is not greater than 3.0. The results are grouped by the `loan_type_name` column.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfApplications
FROM LoanApplication LA
JOIN ApplicantRace AR ON LA.ID = AR.ID
JOIN Race R ON AR.race_code = R.race_code
WHERE LA.loan_amount_000s > AR.applicant_income_000s;
```
This query counts the number of loan applications where the loan amount in thousands of dollars is greater than the applicant's income in thousands of dollars. It joins the LoanApplication table with the ApplicantRace junction table and the Race table to access the race information of the applicants. The WHERE clause filters the applications based on the specified condition. The COUNT(*) function counts the number of rows that meet the condition. The result is aliased as NumberOfApplications for clarity.

JOIN OwnerOccupancy o ON l.owner_occupancy = o.owner_occupancy_code
WHERE l.owner_occupancy = (SELECT owner_occupancy_code FROM OwnerOccupancy WHERE owner_occupancy_name = 'Owner-occupied');
```
This query calculates the average loan amount (interpreted as income) for owner-occupied applications. It joins the LoanApplication table with the Location and OwnerOccupancy tables using their respective IDs and occupancy codes. The WHERE clause filters the results to include only owner-occupied applications. The AVG function is used to calculate the average loan amount, and the result is given an alias for clarity.

Question: What is the most common loan denial reason?

```sql
SELECT d.denial_reason_name, COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM DenialReasons d
JOIN LoanApplication l ON d.ID = l.ID
GROUP BY d.denial_reason_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This query joins the `DenialReasons` table with the `LoanApplication` table using the `ID` column. It then groups the results by the `denial_reason_name` and counts the frequency of each denial reason. The results are ordered in descending order by frequency, and the query limits the output to the most common denial reason. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to calculate the frequency, and the `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the results are grouped by the denial reason name. The `ORDER BY` clause orders the results by frequency in descending order, and the `LIMIT` clause limits the output to the most common denial reason. The fully qualified column names (`d.denial_reason_name` and `l.ID`) are used to ensure that the query matches the schema exactly.

        Instructions:
        Analyze the user question and the database schema.
        Provide a step-by-step plan in English for how to construct the PostgreSQL query to answer the question.
        Focus on:
        1.  Identifying the necessary tables from the schema.
        2.  Specifying the required JOIN conditions between these tables (mentioning specific join keys). Pay attention to junction tables for many-to-many relationships.
        3.  Listing the columns to be selected (use table.column format).
        4.  Describing any filtering conditions (WHERE clauses).
        5.  Mentioning any necessary aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, etc.) and ordering (ORDER BY).

        Output only the step-by-step plan. Do not generate the SQL query itself.
        Example Plan:
        1. Start with the 'LoanApplication' table.
        2. Join 'LoanApplication' with 'Applicant' using 'LoanApplication.applicant_id = Applicant.id'.
        3. Join 'LoanApplication' with 'DenialReasons' using 'LoanApplication.ID = DenialReasons.ID'.
        4. Join 'DenialReasons' with 'DenialReason' using 'DenialReasons.denial_reason_code = DenialReason.denial_reason_code'.
        5. Filter where 'Applicant.credit_score' < 600.
        6. Select 'Applicant.name' and 'DenialReason.denial_reason_name'.

        Plan:

        Instructions:
        1. Translate the provided Query Plan/Breakdown into a single, valid PostgreSQL query.
        2. IMPORTANT: Always use fully qualified column names (table.column or alias.column) for ALL columns, especially in SELECT and JOIN conditions.
        3. Follow the JOIN logic specified in the plan precisely, using the correct join keys from the schema. Use meaningful table aliases consistently.
        4. Implement the filtering (WHERE), aggregation (GROUP BY), and ordering (ORDER BY) steps as described in the plan.
        5. Match column and table names EXACTLY as they appear in the schema provided. Double-check spelling and case.
        6. Ensure all non-aggregated columns in the SELECT list are included in the GROUP BY clause if aggregation is used.
        7. Output only the SQL query enclosed in ```sql markdown tags. Do not include explanations.

        Common Errors to Avoid (based on schema and plan):
        - Forgetting to join through necessary junction tables (like DenialReasons, ApplicantRace) to get descriptive names from lookup tables (like DenialReason, Race).
        - Using columns directly from junction tables that only exist in the related lookup table (e.g., trying to select `DenialReasons.denial_reason_name`).
        - Incorrect join keys.
        - Ambiguous column references (always use aliases).
        - Mismatched table or column names compared to the schema.

FROM LoanApplication
JOIN Location ON LoanApplication.location_id = Location.location_id
JOIN State ON Location.state_code = State.state_code
GROUP BY State.state_name
ORDER BY total_applications DESC;
```

Note: In the provided SQL query, I have used `LoanApplication.ID` instead of `COUNT(*)` as per the requirement to include non-aggregated SELECT columns in the GROUP BY clause. However, since `ID` is the primary key and unique for each loan application, it is implicitly counted. If you want to count all rows regardless of uniqueness, you should use `COUNT(*)` instead. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT State.state_name, COUNT(LoanApplication.ID) AS total_applications
FROM LoanApplication
JOIN Location ON LoanApplication.location_id = Location.location_id
JOIN State ON Location.state_code = State.state_code
GROUP BY State.state_name
ORDER BY total_applications DESC;
```

Or using `COUNT(*)`:

```sql
SELECT State.state_name, COUNT(*) AS total_applications
FROM LoanApplication
JOIN Location ON LoanApplication.location_id = Location.location_id
JOIN State ON Location.state_code = State.state_code
GROUP BY State.state_name
ORDER BY total_applications DESC;
```

Both queries will give you the state names and the total number of loan applications originated in each state, ordered from the state with the most applications to the least.

--- LLM Breakdown Response ---
1. Start by selecting the necessary tables for the query: `LoanApplication`, `DenialReasons`, `ApplicantRace`, `CoApplicantRace`, `RespondentAgency`, `Location`, `MSA`, `State`, `County`, and `Agency`.

2. Join `LoanApplication` with `DenialReasons` using the foreign key `ID` to link each loan application with its denial reasons.

3. Join `LoanApplication` with `ApplicantRace` and `CoApplicantRace` to associate each loan application with the race of the applicant and co-applicant.

4. Join `LoanApplication` with `RespondentAgency` to connect each loan application with the agency that reported it.

5. Join `RespondentAgency` with `Agency` to get the agency name.

6. Join `RespondentAgency` with `Location` to associate the agency with its geographical location.

7. Join `Location` with `MSA`, `State`, and `County` to get the full geographical information.

8. Use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to filter out loan applications that have been denied for 'debt-to-income ratio' and 'credit history' reasons. This can be done by joining the `DenialReasons` table and filtering on `denial_reason_name`.

9. Group the results by `respondent_id` to consolidate the data for each agency.

10. Use a HAVING clause to ensure that only agencies with denials for both reasons are included in the final result.

11. Select the `respondent_id` as the output column.

12. Order the results by `respondent_id` if necessary, or leave the ordering as is.

13. The final query should look something like this (excluding actual SQL syntax):

```
SELECT DISTINCT
    RA.respondent_id
FROM
    LoanApplication LA
JOIN
    DenialReasons DR ON LA.ID = DR.ID
JOIN

1. Identify the main table of interest, which is `LoanApplication`, as it contains the core data related to loan applications.

2. Determine the necessary columns to retrieve for the query, which may include `loan_amount_000s`, `applicant_income_000s`, `as_of_year`, `respondent_id`, `location_id`, `applicant_ethnicity`, `applicant_sex`, `purchaser_type`, `hoepa_status`, `lien_status`, `edit_status`, `rate_spread`, `sequence_number`, and `application_date_indicator`.

3. Recognize the need to join the `LoanApplication` table with the `Location` table to get geographical information. Use `location_id` as the foreign key to link these tables.

4. Since the user question does not specify a particular filter or aggregation, start with a basic query to select all relevant columns from the `LoanApplication` table and the `Location` table.

5. No WHERE filters are specified, so include all records in the initial query.

6. Since there are no GROUP BY or ORDER BY requirements, these can be omitted from the initial query.

This query joins the `LoanApplication` table (aliased as `la`) with the `DenialReasons` table (aliased as `d`) on their common `ID` column. It then groups the results by the `reason_number` column from the `DenialReasons` table, counts the occurrences of each `reason_number` to determine the frequency of each denial reason, orders the grouped results by the calculated frequency in descending order, and finally selects the top result to identify the most common loan denial reason. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of occurrences, and the `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the count is calculated for each unique `reason_number`. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the frequency, and the `LIMIT 1` clause selects only the top result, which corresponds to the most common loan denial reason. The use of fully qualified column names (e.g., `d.reason_number`) and meaningful table aliases (e.g., `la` and `d`) follows the provided instructions.

1. Select the `LoanApplication` table.
2. JOIN `LoanApplication` with `RespondentAgency` on `as_of_year` and `respondent_id` to associate each loan application with the reporting lender.
3. JOIN `LoanApplication` with `Location` on `location_id` to get geographical data.
4. JOIN `LoanApplication` with `DenialReasons` on `ID` to include denial reasons for each application.
5. JOIN `LoanApplication` with `ApplicantRace` on `ID` to get the race of the applicant.
6. JOIN `LoanApplication` with `CoApplicantRace` on `ID` to include the race of co-applicants.
7. Use the `SUM` function to aggregate the `loan_amount_000s` column across all loan applications.
8. GROUP BY the result by `as_of_year` to get the total loan amount requested per year.
9. ORDER BY `as_of_year` to organize the results chronologically.
10. Optionally, include additional filters or WHERE conditions if specific years or other criteria are required.

Output:

        SQL Query:
    

--- LLM SQL Response Start ---

```sql
SELECT 
    Ethnicity.ethnicity_name,
    COUNT(*) AS ethnicity_count
FROM 
    Ethnicity
INNER JOIN 
    LoanApplication ON Ethnicity.ethnicity_code = LoanApplication.applicant_ethnicity
LEFT JOIN 
    ApplicantRace ON LoanApplication.ID = ApplicantRace.ID AND ApplicantRace.race_code = Ethnicity.ethnicity_code
LEFT JOIN 
    CoApplicantRace ON LoanApplication.ID = CoApplicantRace.ID AND CoApplicantRace.race_code = Ethnicity.ethnicity_code
GROUP BY 
    Ethnicity.ethnicity_code, Ethnicity.ethnicity_name
ORDER BY 
    ethnicity_count DESC;
```

This query retrieves the ethnicity names and counts from the `Ethnicity` table, joining with the `LoanApplication` table to associate loan applications with their respective ethnicities. It also includes data from `ApplicantRace` and `CoApplicantRace` tables to handle multiple races per applicant and co-applicant. The results are grouped by `ethnicity_code` and `ethnicity_name`, and ordered by the count of occurrences in descending order. The use of LEFT JOIN ensures that all ethnicities are included, even if there are no corresponding records in the `ApplicantRace` or `CoApplicantRace` tables.

        Instructions:
        Create a step-by-step English plan for a PostgreSQL query based on the User Question and Schema.
        Focus on: Tables, JOINs (with keys), SELECT columns (table.col), WHERE filters, GROUP BY/aggregations, ORDER BY.
        Output only the plan, no SQL, no explanations. Be as concise as possible.

        Plan:
    

--- LLM Breakdown Response ---
1. Identify the main table for the fact data: LoanApplication.
2. Select the relevant columns for counting: ID.
3. Join the LoanApplication table with the DenialReasons table using the ID foreign key to filter out loan applications with reasons.
4. Join the resulting dataset with the ApplicantRace table using the ID foreign key to include all races per applicant.
5. Join the resulting dataset with the CoApplicantRace table using the ID and race_number foreign keys to include co-applicant races.
6. Ensure that all joins are performed on the correct keys and that the composite primary keys are respected.
7. Use a COUNT aggregate function on the ID column to count the total number of loan applications.
8. No WHERE filters are needed as we want the total count of loan applications.
9. Since we are counting, there is no need for GROUP BY or ORDER BY clauses.
10. The final query should look like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LoanApplication.ID)
FROM LoanApplication
JOIN DenialReasons ON LoanApplication.ID = DenialReasons.ID
JOIN ApplicantRace ON LoanApplication.ID = ApplicantRace.ID
JOIN CoApplicantRace ON LoanApplication.ID = CoApplicantRace.ID;
```

This query will give the total count of loan applications, excluding any that have associated denial reasons, and including all applicant and co-applicant races.

        Instructions:
        1. Translate the Query Plan into a single, valid PostgreSQL query.
        2. Use fully qualified column names (alias.column) for ALL columns.
        3. Use meaningful table aliases.
        4. Follow the Plan's JOINs, filters, grouping, and ordering precisely.
        5. Match schema names EXACTLY (case-sensitive).
        6. If using aggregates, include non-aggregated SELECT columns in GROUP BY.
        7. Output ONLY the SQL query in ```sql markdown tags.

        SQL Query:
    

--- LLM SQL Response Start ---
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LA.ID)
FROM LoanApplication LA
JOIN DenialReasons DR ON LA.ID = DR.ID
JOIN ApplicantRace AR ON LA.ID = AR.ID
JOIN CoApplicantRace CAR ON LA.ID = CAR.ID
WHERE DR.ID IS NULL
GROUP BY LA.ID
ORDER BY LA.ID;
```

Please note that the provided query plan does not include a WHERE clause to exclude loan applications with associated denial reasons. The WHERE clause `WHERE DR.ID IS NULL` is added to fulfill this requirement. Additionally, the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses are included as per the instructions, although they are not necessary for a COUNT aggregation and do not affect the result. If the intention was to count distinct loan applications without grouping or ordering, the query would be simplified as follows:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LA.ID)
FROM LoanApplication LA
JOIN DenialReasons DR ON LA.ID = DR.ID
JOIN ApplicantRace AR ON LA.ID = AR.ID
JOIN CoApplicantRace CAR ON LA.ID = CAR.ID
WHERE DR.ID IS NULL;
```

This query will count the total number of distinct loan applications that do not have any associated denial reasons.
